## Solana Blockchain

A dedicated `solana.ts` file within a `blockchain/solana/` directory is a great approach for organizing Solana blockchain-related logic in StreamPay project. This file can encapsulate functions and classes that interact with the Solana network, making your codebase more modular and maintainable.

Below is an example outline of what the `solana.ts` file might contain, based on standard Solana operations like connecting to the network, sending transactions, and querying account information:

### `solana.ts` File Outline

```typescript
import { Connection, PublicKey, Keypair, Transaction, SystemProgram, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

class SolanaClient {
    private connection: Connection;

    constructor(clusterUrl: string) {
        this.connection = new Connection(clusterUrl);
    }

    // Connects to the Solana network
    connect(): Connection {
        return this.connection;
    }

    // Retrieves the balance of a given Solana account
    async getBalance(publicKey: PublicKey): Promise<number> {
        return this.connection.getBalance(publicKey);
    }

    // Sends SOL from one account to another
    async sendSol(fromKeypair: Keypair, toPublicKey: PublicKey, amount: number): Promise<string> {
        const transaction = new Transaction().add(
            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: fromKeypair.publicKey,
                toPubkey: toPublicKey,
                lamports: amount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
            }),
        );

        return sendAndConfirmTransaction(this.connection, transaction, [fromKeypair]);
    }

    // Add more Solana related functionalities as needed
}

export default SolanaClient;
```

### Key Points:

1. **Connection Management**: `SolanaClient` manages a connection to the Solana blockchain, established via the provided `clusterUrl`.

2. **Balance Retrieval**: The `getBalance` method fetches the balance of a Solana account.

3. **Sending SOL**: The `sendSol` method handles sending SOL from one account to another. It creates a transaction, signs it with the sender's Keypair, and sends it to the network.

4. **Expandability**: The class can be expanded to include more functionalities, such as interacting with smart contracts, managing tokens, etc.

### Usage:

You can use `SolanaClient` in other parts of your application to interact with the Solana blockchain. For example:

```typescript
import SolanaClient from "./blockchain/solana/solana";

const solanaClient = new SolanaClient("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const balance = await solanaClient.getBalance(new PublicKey("SomePublicKey"));
```

This structure provides a clear and organized way to manage Solana blockchain interactions.
